Measuring the [SpinWaitTest.java](https://github.com/simonis/GilExamples/tree/master/SpinWaitTest) micro-benchmark on on a m6g.metal instance with [OpenJDK tip plus various implementations](https://github.com/simonis/jdk/tree/onSpinWait) of the `Thread.onSpinWait() `intrinsic based on [previous work of Dmitry Chuyko](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~dchuyko/8186670/webrev.00/). In addition to the initial implementation with YIELD, this change adds three additional implementations with either a simple NOP instruction (with `-XX:UseNewCode`), 8 NOP instructions (with `-XX:UseNewCode2`) or an ISB instruction (with `-XX:UseNewCode3`).

The problem with this benchmark is that it has a very large variance of up to 20% on Graviton2. In general, all the implementations perform slightly better than the current version without the intrinsic, but taking the high variance into account it is questionable if this will result in measurable performance improvements in real-world benchmarks or applications.
